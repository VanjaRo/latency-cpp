# PCAP Parsing Issues and Solutions

## 1. Out-of-Sequence Updates

### Description
- Updates are being received out of sequence, causing orderbook state inconsistencies
- Manifests when `header.changeNo != orderbook.changeNo + 1`
- Currently skipping out-of-sequence updates, which may lead to data loss

### Root Causes
- Network packet reordering
- Packet loss in capture
- Multiple data streams interleaving
- Possible race conditions in multi-threaded processing

### Attempted Solutions
1. Implemented sequence number validation in `processUpdateHeader`
2. Added logging for skipped updates
3. Maintaining separate change numbers per instrument

### Potential Improvements
- Implement a reordering buffer with timeout
- Add packet timestamp validation
- Consider implementing a recovery mechanism for missed updates

## 2. VWAP Calculation Precision Issues

### Description
- VWAP calculations showing rounding errors
- Fixed-point conversion may lose precision
- Inconsistent results between updates

### Root Causes
- Double to fixed-point conversion limitations
- Potential overflow in large volume scenarios
- Accumulation of floating-point errors

### Attempted Solutions
1. Implemented fixed-point arithmetic with 6 decimal places
2. Added debug logging for VWAP calculations
3. Storing separate numerator and denominator

### Potential Improvements
- Use higher precision fixed-point representation
- Implement decimal arithmetic library
- Add overflow checks in calculations

## 3. Memory Management in Price Level Updates

### Description
- Potential memory issues when handling price level arrays
- Risk of buffer overflows in high-volume scenarios
- Performance impact from array shifting operations

### Root Causes
- Fixed-size arrays (`MAX_PRICE_LEVELS`)
- Inefficient array shifting in `addPriceLevel` and `deletePriceLevel`
- Possible memory fragmentation

### Attempted Solutions
1. Added bounds checking for array operations
2. Implemented array shifting optimization
3. Limited maximum price levels

### Potential Improvements
- Consider using more efficient data structures (e.g., linked list)
- Implement circular buffer for price levels
- Add memory usage monitoring

## 4. Protocol Parsing Edge Cases

### Description
- Incomplete messages causing parsing failures
- Variable-length integer decoding issues
- Field alignment problems

### Root Causes
- Packet fragmentation
- Endianness issues
- Incorrect field length calculations

### Attempted Solutions
1. Added basic validation in `parsePayload`
2. Implemented robust VInt decoding
3. Added buffer boundary checks

### Potential Improvements
- Add CRC validation
- Implement message reassembly
- Add more extensive error handling

## 5. Performance Bottlenecks

### Description
- Slow processing of high-volume updates
- CPU spikes during price level modifications
- Memory allocation overhead

### Root Causes
- Inefficient data structures
- Excessive copying in update operations
- Frequent memory allocations

### Attempted Solutions
1. Optimized array operations
2. Reduced debug logging
3. Implemented fixed-size buffers

### Potential Improvements
- Profile and optimize hot paths
- Implement lock-free data structures
- Consider memory pooling
- Batch processing of updates

## Next Steps

1. Implement reordering buffer for out-of-sequence updates
2. Optimize VWAP calculations with better precision
3. Profile performance in high-volume scenarios
4. Add comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
5. Implement monitoring and alerting for parsing issues
